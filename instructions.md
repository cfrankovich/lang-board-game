# Novel Board Game Project Instructions

For one of the novels, you will create a game board that also contains game pieces, trivia cards, and instructions. I should have a good understanding of the novel’s plot, characters, setting, theme, and conflict from your game. 

### Steps for creating your game board: 

1. Draw the map of spaces on a poster board. It could be circular, like the board in Monopoly, or one-way, like the board in Candy Land. It will help to consider the story you are basing the game board on and what locations are significant to the novel. Does the story start and end in the same place, or does the main character start in one location and end in another? The game board should accurately reflect the story of the book. 

2. Color the poster board with illustrations and designs to reflect the locations from the book represented in the game. Additionally, consider the setting. The game board should be designed to reflect the setting. So if they are stranded on an island, the board itself should be an island. If the main character visits a cave filled with dragons around the middle of the book, the area of the board around the middle might be decorated with dragons. 

3. Write instructions on some of the spaces to introduce variety to the game and tie in to events from the plot of your novel selection. Some spaces can have instructions to move forward or backward a number of spaces, sit out a turn, roll the dice an extra time, or other instructions that may relate to good/bad events from the story. Look to other board games for inspiration. 

4. Write a minimum of 15 trivia questions on note cards with rewards like an extra turn or moving forward extra spaces if they answer the question correctly, or losing a turn or moving back spaces if they are incorrect. Write instructions on some of the board game spaces to draw a trivia card. This demonstrates, more importantly, an understanding of the material in the book. Write questions regarding characters, setting, conflict, theme, and plot that only someone who has read the book could answer. 

5. Include game play instructions and rules so players can easily and clearly understand how to play the game.

6. A digital version of the project will also be accepted using Canva, Google Slides, or PowerPoint.
