# Novel Board Game
This project is my final for an English class (specifically AICE Lang AS). I'm not sure why I wanted to make my life harder by offering to program this game for the final project but I suppose it will be fun so why not.
For the complete instruction set please look at [instructions.md](https://github.com/cfrankovich/lang-board-game/blob/main/instructions.md). And yes, I did ask my instructor if I could make a program instead of a paper game so its not all for nothing.

## The Novel
The novel I'm using for the game is "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" by Stephen Chbosky (assigned to me). I haven't finished the book yet so I can't explain everything here.

## The Game
So far, I'm planning to make a cheesy turn based game with all the requirements in the [instructions](https://github.com/cfrankovich/lang-board-game/blob/main/instructions.md). Haven't gotten much progress so far to explain everything.

## Technical Stuff
Compile everything just running `make` and executing the binary "game" to play the game.
